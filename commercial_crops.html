<h1>Commercial Crops in Maharashtra</h1>
<p>Commercial crops are cultivated primarily for sale and profit rather than personal consumption or subsistence. In Maharashtra, commercial crops are a significant contributor to the agricultural economy, with the state playing a leading role in the production of sugarcane, cotton, and other high-value crops. These crops often require substantial investment in terms of inputs like irrigation, fertilizers, and pest control, but they also provide higher returns compared to food grains or subsistence crops.</p>
